Tools for Ex-post Survey Data Harmonization

Abstract
Ex-post harmonization of survey data creates new opportunities for research by extending the geographical and/or time coverage of analyses. While an increasing number of scholars combine different survey projects to analyze them as a single dataset, there is substantial variation in the understanding of what ex-post harmonization entails, and with regard to the methods of data processing and documentation. In this paper I propose a procedure and a set of simple tools for the exploration, recoding, and documentation of harmonization of survey data, relying on the programming language R and Excel spreadsheets - both common software among social scientists. This approach combines automation for improved reproducibility and efficiency, with human decision-making that allows for flexibility necessary in dealing with the variation and diverse standard observed in survey datasets. The resulting documentation of the harmonization process is user-friendly and readible without the knolwedge of any programming language. Variables on trust in institutions from three cross-national survey projects serve as an illustrate of the proposed workflow.
