## Harmonization toolbox

This repository contains various resources for secondary analysis of cross-national survey data, including ex-post survey data harmonization, such as survey metadata tables, crosswalks, and workflow ideas.

### Eurobarometer variables list

The [Eurobarometer variables list](https://github.com/mkolczynska/harmonization-toolbox/tree/master/survey-metadata) provides a list of all variables in all Eurobarometer rounds available through the [GESIS Data Catalogue](https://dbk.gesis.org/) as of September 2020.

The variable labels and variable groups originate from [GESIS ZACAT](https://zacat.gesis.org/webview/). The variable labels need not be identical to those in the actual data (although in practice they almost always are).
